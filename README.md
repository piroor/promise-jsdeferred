# Promise.jsm-JSDeferred

## What's this?

A combination of the [Promise.jsm](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm) and the [JSDeferred](https://github.com/cho45/jsdeferred). In other words, this is a JSDeferred-compatible implementation based on Promise.jsm, or, JSDeferred-flavoured Promise.jsm.
